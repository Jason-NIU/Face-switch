The program is intended to help computer users with limited mobility from the neck down but who have a good level of control of facial muscles.\r\nThe software is intended to be used in combination with the Tobii PCEye Go eye tracker (http://www.tobii.com/en/assistive-technology/global/products/hardware/pceye/) and Tobii's accessibility software for computer controlled through gaze: Tobii Gaze Interaction Software 2.6.2. (http://www.tobii.com/en/assistive-technology/global/products/hardware/pceye/support-downloads/)\r\nThe program uses the Beyond Reality Face Tracker SDK (https://www.beyond-reality-face.com/)to track facial landmark features (lips, eyebrows, face contour etc.) from which it infers face gestures invariant to head position.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe user can select how many gestures the software monitors from 1 to 4 by selecting the check boxes on the left of each gesture name. However, as the number of gestures to be recognized increases, the number of false positives detection during computer interaction increases. We have noted differences among people, with different users getting different degrees of performance for different gestures.\r\n\r\nThe user can map each gesture to a specific keystroke. By clicking on the drop-down menu of the list of options associated to each gesture, the user can select common keys such as page down or F12 (default switch used by the Tobii Gaze Interaction Software). For customize situations, any keyboard key can be pressed since the drop-down menu is editable.\r\n\r\nThe user can adjust the sensitivity of the program by moving the slide below the drop-down menu. Values closer to 0 make gestures detection more likely but it also increments the false detection rate.\r\n\r\nIf the face tracker loses accurate tracking of facial landmarks, the user should exit and reenter the field of view of the camera for restarting the face tracking engine.\r\n\r\nIf performance degrades over time, the user should press the calibration button to restart the distance theresholds between landmark points used for gesture detection.\r\n\r\nIf the user wishes to pause the program, there is a corresponding button to do so.\r\n\r\nMappings and sensitivity values can be reset with the corresponding button.\r\n\r\nA user can save a specific set of gesture mapping to keystrokes by pressing the button save. In a later session, clicking the button load restores the active gestures, mappings and sensitivity values previously saved.\r\n\r\nFor facial gestures are permitted:\r\n\r\n-Opening mouth: the gesture is completed by opening and closing the mouth.\r\n![Opened mouth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason-NIU/Face-switch/master/screenshots/open.png)\r\n\r\n![Closed mouth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason-NIU/Face-switch/master/screenshots/normal.png)\r\n\r\n-Raising eyebrows: the gesture is completed by raising the eyebrows and dropping them afterwards.\r\n![Raising eyebrows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason-NIU/Face-switch/master/screenshots/rising%20eyebrow.png)\r\n\r\n-Smile: the gesture is completed by generating a simple smile with the lips.\r\n![smile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason-NIU/Face-switch/master/screenshots/smile.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n-Snarling: the gesture is completed by making a nose twitch.\r\n\r\n![Snarling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason-NIU/Face-switch/master/screenshots/nose.png)\r\n\r\nBelow you can find a video that illustrates the performance of the system.\r\n\r\n### Video Demonstration\r\n\r\nDemo 1 for typing test         http://youtu.be/DXKa6hj2uFg   \r\nDemo 2 for browsing webpages   http://youtu.be/0vOrGOliwR8","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
